# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

**_Overview_**

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type, which are used to train a model to classify patients into those with or without heart disease.

**_Files_**

- HeartDiseasePrediction_ML.docx: This document provides a detailed overview of the project, including its objectives, methodologies, and results.

- heart.csv: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.

- heart_disease.pptx: This PowerPoint presentation summarizes the project's key findings and insights.

- heartdiseaseprediction_project.py: This Python script contains the code implementation of the machine learning model for heart disease prediction.

**_Methodology_**

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various visualizations are created to explore the relationships between different features and the target variable.

- Model Development: Several machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated using cross-validation to predict heart disease.

- Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Deployment: The best-performing model is selected and deployed for making predictions on new data.

**_Usage_**

- Clone the repository
- Install the required dependencies
- Run the Python script
